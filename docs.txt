async require(self, roles: Iterable[Role]) -> None:
    Provides a role-based access control mechanism. Each message handler
    should call this method before doing anything else, with the required
    roles as a parameter.

    The default implementation will look up the set of roles associated
    with the currently authenticated user within the database's security
    collection.

    Throws AccessDenied if the set of roles associated with the currently
    authenticated does not contain ALL of the required roles.
